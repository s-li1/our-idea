# Inspiration

There's so many fantastic project ideas out there, yet it's always difficult to find and connect with people who share your enthusiasm and interest in bringing your idea to life. We've all had times where we wanted to find the perfect people to work with and drawing inspiration from speed matching apps like Tinder, Our Idea came along.

# What is OurIdea?

Our Idea allows users to "swipe left" or "swipe right" on innovative ideas submitted by other users. You can match with teams, chat with them in real-time immediately on your ðŸ’¯ideas, and create connections for life!

# How we built it

We prototyped everything in Figma first! Always ðŸ¤ 

We played around with React and Material UI on the front-end and agonized over pure CSS.

We also employed the swiss army knife of hackathonsâ€“ðŸ”¥Firebase ðŸ”¥â€“and its multiple functionalities (Firestore!)

# Challenges we ran into

As it was our first time using Firebase, we had a lot of fun with it. However, it also brought a few problems! Just mere hours before submission, we reached our usage limit and it was a race to finish.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our Idea is a labor of love and we learned so much doing it. There were a lot of tired Discord calls, LiveShare trouble, moments of panicked silence and muted mics, but we're so proud of the project and its potential to connect individuals on the basis of good ideasâ€“just like this hackathon has!
